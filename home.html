The first time you called me on February 2nd, you told me that my accent and voice brought back some memories for you, it was the exact same for me, except the sound of your laugh. I donâ€™t think I loved how you laughed this much before, I swear, it feels like firecrackers going off inside my brain, it is the brightest, purest thing, it makes me feel so happy to hear you like that, full of joy! I hope you're always happy and loved.</p> <p align = "left">Thank you for being so sweet to me everyday, I adore you. I hope we can talk a lot in the days to come!</p> <p align = "left">Lots and lots and lots of love,</p><p align = "left"> Atrayee.</p></p>
